## 1. Brief recap
### A) Exponential Discounting
 
At time $t$, the person aims to maximize 
$$u_t + \delta u_{t+1} + \delta^2 u_{t+2} + \dots ,$$
where $\delta$ captures both short-term and long-term discoutning.
 
**Implications**
 * Constant discouting: $\delta$ does not change over horizon.
 * Dynamic consistency: no preference reversals.
 * No demand for commitment.
 
### B) Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting (present bias or present focus)
At time $t$, the person aims to maximize 
$$u_t + \beta \delta u_{t+1} + \beta \delta^2 u_{t+2} + \dots ,$$
where $0 < \beta \leq 1$ is short-run discount factor, $0 < \delta \leq 1$ is long-run discount factor. 
* $\beta$ is additional time preference parameter that measures an individual's **present bias**.
 
### C) Sophistication vs Naive
* Present bias create time inconsistency
    * When thinking ahead to the future, we want to be patient.
    * When the time actually comes, we are impatient.
* Full Naive: $\hat{\beta} = 1$
* Sophistication: $\hat{\beta} = \beta$
* Awareness issue doesn't arise with exponential discounting, because no time inconsistency, so no question whether person is aware of it.

### D) Partial Naive
* $\hat{\beta}$ measures beliefs about future $\beta$.
    * Full sophistication ($\beta = \hat{\beta} < 1$)
    * Full naive ($\beta < \hat{\beta} = 1$)
    * Intermediate ($\beta < \hat{\beta} < 1$), understand present bias but *underestimate*. Overcommitment.

## 2. Demand for commitment
**Commitment device**: 
* an arrangement entered into by an agent who <u>restricts his or her future choice set by making certain choices more (perhaps infinitely) expensive</u>.
* On the margin, pay somehting in the *present* to make those choices more expensive, even if they received no other benefit for the payment.

**Heart of the issue:** 
* time-inconsistent preferences. 

**Demand for commitment requires (at least partial) sophistication.**
* (Fully) naive agents see no reason to restrict their choice set. They think they can follow through their plans.
* A (partially) naive person *underestimate* their present bias and might thus
    1. Not demand a commitment device that'd help;
    2. Demand a commitment device that doesn't actually help.
 
**Takeaway**: 
 1. commitment device might not be effective
 2. Substitution across temptation goods can mitigate usefulness of commitment.
 3. Conditions required for the device to be helpful
     * The person needs to have a <u>self-control problem</u> ($\beta < 1$)
     * The person needs to be at least <u>partially sophisticated</u> ($\hat{\beta} < 1$).
     * The commitment device needs to be <u>effective</u>.
     * The person needs to <u>*think*</u> the commitment device is effective.
         
**Examples**
* Sloan deadlines, indian workers, gym memberships.
* Clever bundling of temptations
    * **Idea**: combine investment good with leisure good.
    
## 3. Commitment devices: summary
* Significant share of population struggle with self-control problems, and many of them are at least partially sophisticated.
* High variation in fraction demanding commitment across settings, and not much evidence of commitment device that actually help.
* Commitment contracts can harm partially naive individuals as they fail to follow through the plan.
