## 1. How do economists think about human behavior?
* Goal-driven individual behavior: constrained optimization
    1. **Utility function/preferences**: what makes people happy ...
        * ... at a moment in time (instantaneous utility function)?
        * ... when time, risk, or others are involved (time, risk, and social preferences)?
    2. **Beliefs**: what do people believe about their environment?
        * Physical environment and others' behavior.
        * Use of information to update their beliefs.
    3. **Choice/Decision-making**: How do people use the above to make decisions?
        * Some influences on behavior aren’t about utility or beliefs.
        * Frames, defaults, and nudges; heuristics.
* Psychological insights can help us under stand each of these components.

## 2. Utility/Preferences
* Classical econ assume people are selfish, but people care about otherss in other ways than pure altruism.
* Key questions:
    1. What is the nature of such social preferences, i.e. the motivation to help/hurt others?
    2. How does the presence of others affect our utility (thus actions)?

### A) Social preferences: dictator game
> Imagine you have been given $10 to split between yourself and another, randomly chosen, MIT undergraduate. You can keep any part of the $10 to yourself, and give the rest of the $10 to the other student.

> The question was asked in three ways:
(1) Recipient is informed about the circumstances of the decision.
(2) Recipient might never notice (money is wired anonymously).
(3) Recipient might never notice but your friends will find out how much you gave

* First case giving is higher than the second case. Why?
    * People care about what others think
* (Why) does it matter whether decisions are made public?
    * People care about their social images, i.e. what others think about them.


### B) Time preferences: weight-loss bets
* Strange bets because this is betting on something, in principle, one has complete control. However, overall >80% of the betters lose.

#### i. Internal Conflicts
* Two possible explanations
    1. Betters naively think they can lose weight.
    2. They make the bt to give themselves incentives to lose weight.
* **Internal conflict**: people want to diet, but when the time comes for the pain, they don’t carry through.
* Similar conflict between short-run desires and long-term goals is apparent in many people’s exercising habits.

#### ii. Present Bias (source of conflict)
> Suppose I could give you either $100 in cash in **52 weeks** or $x in cash in **54 weeks**. What is the x for which you would be indifferent between the two options?
>    * Mean x = $108; median x = $104
>    
> Suppose I could give you either $100 in cash right **now** or $x in cash **in 2 weeks**. What is the x for which you would be indifferent between the two options?
>    * Mean x = $123; median x = $110

### C) Time preferences: summary
* People are relatively <u>patient</u> for <u>far-off decisions</u>.
    * That is like a person who decides she wants to diet in the future.
* People are <u>less patient</u> for <u>immediately</u> relevant decisions.
    * That’s like a person who, when facing immediate sacrifice, is not willing to carry through her diet.
* **Two major questions:**
    1. The conflict between short-run desires and long-run goals.
    2. Whether and how people predict their own future utility and behavior.

## 3. Beliefs
### A) Mistakes in Objective Probability Judgments:  Heuristics and Biases
People tend to ignore the ***base rate***.

* Bayesian thinking is a cognitively difficult process.
* We often respond cognitively demanding tasks with quick intuitive shortcuts (heuristics) that lead to *systematic* biases in judgements.
* We study whether such biases lead to important mistakes in people's choices.

### B) Biases in Subjective Probability Judgments
People, especially men, tend to be overoptimistic about their prospects and abilities relative to others.
> Male students: own prob: 50%; prob for others: 41%
> Female students: own prob: 40.3%; prob for others: 47.2%


## 4. Choice
Some influences on behavior aren’t about utility or beliefs.
* Anchoring
* Loss Aversion/Framing (violations of expected utility theory)

### A) What matters for helping behavior? (Darley and Batson, 1973)
> What matters for helping behavior?
> (1) Lecture on Parable of the Good Samaritan vs. other content
> (2) Variation in time pressure (hurry)
> (3) Personality measures of religiosity

**Main outcome:** fraction who stopped and offered to help
* Hurry condition very important.
> * No hurry: 63% stopped
> * Medium hurry: 45% stopped
> * High hurry: 10% stopped

* Personality characteristics don’t seem to predict behavior.
* Situations can matter a great deal. **Preferences can be malleable**.
